                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Woody, a 15-year-old programming enthusiast from southern England. My passion lies in
                    designing and coding intuitive applications, and I have a soft spot for trains. My coding journey
                    began in 2015 on a flight from Berlin when my father introduced me to <a
                        href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, a simple block coding language, to
                    keep me
                    entertained. Little did I know, this would ignite a fascination with programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I eagerly peered over my father's shoulder as he tinkered with <a href="https://php.net"
                        target="_blank">PHP</a>, and soon enough, I was diving into coding
                    myself. Most of my programming knowledge has been self-taught since then, a journey fueled by
                    curiosity
                    and a love for problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A pivotal experience for me was working with a small yet bustling Minecraft server. The owner
                    generously allowed me to develop for the server, opening doors to the world of version control with
                    <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and the importance of code reviews. This
                    exposure not only enhanced my technical skills but also
                    instilled in me the principles of writing clean and readable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In essence, my journey in the world of coding has been an exciting adventure so far, from playful
                    beginnings with Scratch to honing my skills on a Minecraft server and now working on my very own
                    train app. I am excited to see where this journey will take me next.
