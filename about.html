                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Woody, a 15 year old developer from the south of England. I love creating intuitive software
                    and all things trains. Back in 2015, on a flight to London from Berlin, my Dad introduced me to <a
                        href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, a simple block coding language, to
                    keep me
                    entertained. Little did I know, this would ignite a fascination with programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I constantly looked at my father's screen as he tinkered and experimented with <a
                        href="https://php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, and before long I was writing my own code. I've
                    taught myself most of what I know since, driven by curiosity and a passion for puzzles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the best opportunities I had was developing for a small but active Minecraft server. The
                    owner was kind enough to give me access to develop for the server and in doing so opened my eyes to
                    version control with <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and code reviews (making
                    me almost want to rip my hair out). This taught me not only technical skills which have helped in
                    other areas but also instilled good habits for writing readable and efficient code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, I've had a ton of fun coding for various personal projects. From tinkering with Scratch,
                    to improving my skills on a Minecraft server, to now developing my own train app. I am excited to
                    see where this journey will take me next.
